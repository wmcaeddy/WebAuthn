# Product Guidelines

## Visual Aesthetic
*   **Premium Brand Identity:** The interface prioritizes a premium, high-fidelity experience aligned with the Fairline brand. A specific color palette (Wedgewood Blue, Outer Space Grey) is used to create a professional and trustworthy aesthetic, complemented by scroll-triggered animations.

## Communication & Messaging
*   **Informative & Direct:** The system will provide clear, step-by-step instructions (e.g., "Insert your security key" or "Look at the camera for FaceID"). Success and failure messages will be immediate and easy to understand.

## Mobile & Cross-Device UX
*   **Universal Clarity:** The primary focus is a clean and clear user experience that translates seamlessly between workstations and mobile devices. The layout should be intuitive regardless of screen size, ensuring that registration and login tasks are easy to complete on any platform.
