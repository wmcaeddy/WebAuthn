# Implementation Plan - Fix PHP Syntax Error

This plan outlines the steps to fix the syntax error and verify the fix.

## Phase 1: Fix
Goal: Resolve the syntax error.

- [x] Task: Correct the quote escaping in `_test/server.php` for the "Delete" button line.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Syntax Fix' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Verification
Goal: Ensure the preview loads and functions.

- [x] Task: Verify the Server Data Preview iframe displays the credential list.
- [x] Task: Verify that clicking "Delete" no longer causes a JSON error (it should refresh the iframe).
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Verification' (Protocol in workflow.md)
